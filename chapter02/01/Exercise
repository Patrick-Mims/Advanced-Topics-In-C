Exercise 1
**********

A survey of ten pop artists is made.

Each person votes for an artist by specifying the number of the artist (a value from 1 to 10).

Each voter is allowed one vote for the artist of their choice.

The vote is recorded as a number from 1 to 10.

The number of voters is unknown beforehand, but the votes are terminated by a vote of 0.

Any vote that is not a number from 1 to 10 is a spoiled vote.

A file, votes.txt, contains the names of the candidates.

The first name is considered as candidate 1, the second as candidate 2, and so on.

The names are followed by the votes.

Write a program to read the data and evaluate the results of the survey.
